My first mini project, which I build during 3rd sem in GEU pursuing B.tech CSE
In this mini project, I learned about GEE (Google Earth Engine), and its code editor, and saw the fascinating satellite imagery manipulation through
Javascript language, where I picked my hometown rishikesh, and classifies its Land cover as:
 1. Water
 2. Forest
 3. Urban
 4.  Baren land
 5.  Vegetation
 6.  Dry soil


Bands used - 11-4-8
             11-8-2

Then i fed that dataset to RandomForest classifier ML model, and presented the result on the map.

This right here is my journey to the end, although i apologize that thorugh this, the timeline of me doing it, is not visible
as i uploaded every file very later on..so sorry about that!
